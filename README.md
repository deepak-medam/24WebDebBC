- Internet is Simply put a long wire connecting different computers.
- Servers help you find all the files and data you require to access and interact with certain websites. Any computer that user would use to access the internet is called a **Client.**
- A web server is like a giant library ready to serve you 24/7.



- When you want to visit a website like google.com.
  - First your browser will send a request to your **ISP(Internet Service Provider)** saying that you want to see google.com.
  - In second step your ISP will forward the request to **DNS Server(Domain Name System)**. DNS Server is like a phonebook.
  - In Third step the DNS server will look up the exact IP address of Google or any website that you are trying to access. Any computer that is connected to the Internet has a unique IP address, it's like a post code for your computer.
  - In fourth step your DNS will send back the IP address of the respective website to your browser.
  - Then You can make a direct request to the IP address and the server at that IP address will send back the required files to access the website.


- You can use <a style="color:#C7253E">**nslookup.io**</a> to search for DNS address of the website.
- There are massive undersea cables that are connecting all the continents. You can visit <a style="color:#C7253E">**submarinecablemap.com**</a> you can see all these cables connecting all the countries.

- The data that you receive from DNS server usually consists of three types of files
  - <span style="color:#C7253E">HTML </span>
  - <span style="color:#C7253E">CSS</span>
  - <span style="color:#C7253E">JavaScript</span>
- <span style="color:#C7253E">HTML</span> file is responsible for content of your web page like text, images, buttons etc.
- <span style="color:#C7253E"> CSS </span> files are responsible for styling the website like color, font. CSS file determines how your website will look. It targets all the content in the webpage you created using HTML and applies styling to those elements.
- <span style="color:#C7253E"> JavaScript </span> files are the ones that allows website to do stuff or have functionality. It turns static website into something functional that user can actually interact with.
