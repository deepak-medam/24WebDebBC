### How Does Internet Actually Work?
- Internet is Simply put a long wire connecting different computers.
- Servers help you find all the files and data you require to access and interact with certain websites. Any computer that user would use to access the internet is called a **Client.**
- A web server is like a giant library ready to serve you 24/7.
- When you want to visit a website like google.com:
  - First your browser will send a request to your **ISP (Internet Service Provider)** saying that you want to see google.com.
  - In the second step, your ISP will forward the request to the **DNS Server (Domain Name System)**. DNS Server is like a phonebook.
  - In the third step, the DNS server will look up the exact IP address of Google or any website that you are trying to access. Any computer that is connected to the Internet has a unique IP address, it's like a post code for your computer.
  - In the fourth step, your DNS will send back the IP address of the respective website to your browser.
  - Then you can make a direct request to the IP address, and the server at that IP address will send back the required files to access the website.
- You can use [**nslookup.io**](https://nslookup.io) to search for the DNS address of the website.
- There are massive undersea cables that are connecting all the continents. You can visit [**submarinecablemap.com**](https://submarinecablemap.com) to see all these cables connecting all the countries.
### How do Websites actually work?
- The data that you receive from the DNS server usually consists of three types of files:
  - **HTML**
  - **CSS**
  - **JavaScript**
- **HTML** file is responsible for the content of your web page, like text, images, buttons, etc.
- **CSS** files are responsible for styling the website, like color, font. The CSS file determines how your website will look. It targets all the content in the webpage you created using HTML and applies styling to those elements.
- **JavaScript** files are the ones that allow the website to do stuff or have functionality. It turns a static website into something functional that the user can actually interact with.

## Introduction to HTML

This approach uses standard Markdown formatting, which is more consistently supported across different platforms. Let me know if you have any other questions!
